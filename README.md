[Ideone](https://www.ideone.com) is an online compiler and debugging tool which allows you to compile source code and execute it online in more than 60 programming languages and you can also save your code there.\
Many people like to save daily codes in Ideone as it is light and easy to use. People face a problem when they save a lot of codes then they cant find a spacific code instantly as there is no search search box in Ideone.\
In this project we simply automated this searching and implement some other tool to make life easier.
